## Hallo! This is Yue YU（俞越）! 


I am currently a postdoc at [University of Southern California](https://sites.usc.edu/mjlab/) and supervised by Prof. Mengjie Yu. 
Before that, I spent six years at [CUHK](https://opto-ee-cuhk-edu-hk.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=zh-CN&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN&_x_tr_pto=sc) as a postgraduate student. Pls kindly check my latest [CV](/CV_YUYUE.pdf).

During my postgraduate studies, I focus on design, fabrication, and characterization of high-performance micro/nanodevices on various integrated photonic platforms including lithium niobate on insulator, silicon on insulator, silica, etc. My works can be divided into following two parts:

### (Ⅰ) Ultralow-loss integrated photonics on lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform
1. By applying the principle of “bound states in the continuum (BICs)”, high-performance integrated photonic devices were developed on a new hybrid photonic architecture at near-visible wavelengths, which allows confining and guiding photons using low-refractive-index waveguides without etching of the single-crystal substrate. Based on this strategy, a series of fundamental components, including waveguides, microcavities, power splitter, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, multimode directional couplers, were demonstrated on this platform. This work has been published in [[Adv. Opt. Mater. 9, 2100060 (2021)](/AOM2021_YU.pdf)].
2. On-chip arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) with the best reported performance yet was achieved on lithium niobate integrated photonic platforms. The demonstrated AWGs will enable new applications in high-capacity telecommunication, high-resolution imaging, and high-speed sensing. This work has been published in [[ACS Photonics 9, 3253–3259 (2022)](/ACS2022_YU.pdf)].
3. Acousto-optic modulation was explored on this platform to leverage the strong piezoelectric effect on LiNbO3. This research results have been published in [[Nanophotonics 10, 4323 (2021)](/Nanop2021_YU.pdf)]. This efficient acousto-optic modulation was further utilized to build a on-chip multiple passband microwave photonic (MWP) filter. Compared with former MWP filters, ours feature a high resolution, compact device footprint, and low energy consumption, which can be applied to television, mobile, satellite communications, or radar applications, where the center frequency is usually fixed and a narrow bandwidth is desired. This work has been accepted by Laser & Photonics Reviews.
4. Second-harmonic-generation was also explored on this platform considering the strong optical nonlinearity of LiNbO3.  . Due to the opposite thermo-optic coefficients of the polymer and lithium niobate, this our structure shows a large thermal stability with a wavelength shift of only 1.7 nm from 25°C to 100°C. This work has been published in [[Laser & Photon. Rev. 16, 2100429 (2022)](/LPR2022_YE.pdf)].
5. Due to the generic mechanism of BIC, this architecture can be extended directly to other functional materials and easily integrated with 2D materials for different applications in optical communications, nonlinear optics at the single-photon level, and scalable photonic quantum information processors. Photon emission by sandwiching a monolayer WS2 between a BIC-based photonic waveguide and lithium niobate substrate was demonstrated, which holds great promise for building on-chip quantum light sources without fabrication challenges. This work havs been published in [[Nano Lett. 23, 3209-3216 (2023)](/NL2023_YU.pdf)].
6. For those who interested on BIC-based etchless PICs, a detailed tutorial including theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and fabrication processes of low-refractive-index PICs was published in [[J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 40, 2801-2808 (2023)](/Josab2023_YU.pdf)].

### (Ⅱ) Mechanical bound states in the continuum
To minimize the mechanical dissipation in micro/nanomechanical resonators, the concept of BIC was applied in the design of optomechanical resonators and, for the first time, the mechanical BICs in optomechanical resonators were experimentally realized and observed. Compared with conventional designs, the demonstrated high-quality optomechanical resonators are robust against structural variations, which substantially reduces the device fabrication difficulties and allows for their operation in versatile environments. This work has been publised in [[Light Sci. Appl. 11, 328 (2022)](/LSA2022_YU.pdf)].
