## Hallo! This is Yue YU（俞越）! 
### I am looking for a postdoctoral position beginning in 2023. Contact me by yyucuhk@link.cuhk.edu.hk.

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [CUHK](https://opto-ee-cuhk-edu-hk.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=zh-CN&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN&_x_tr_pto=sc). Pls kindly check my latest [CV](/CV_YUYUE.pdf).

During my postgraduate studies, I focus on design, fabrication, and characterization of high-performance micro/nanodevices on various integrated photonic platforms including lithium niobate on insulator, silicon on insulator, silica, etc. A brief introduction to my recent works will be added to this page later.

### (Ⅰ) Ultralow-loss integrated photonics on lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform
To achieve high-performance integrated photonic devices, we applied the principle of “bound states in the continuum (BICs)” to develop a new hybrid photonic architecture at near-visible wavelengths, which allows confining and guiding photons using low-refractive-index waveguides without etching of the single-crystal substrate. Based on this strategy, we have successfully demonstrated a series of fundamental components, including waveguides, microcavities, power splitter, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, multimode directional couplers, etc. This work has been published in [[Adv. Opt. Mater. 9, 2100060 (2021)](/AOM2021_YU.pdf)]. We also demonstrated on-chip arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) with the best reported performance yet achieved on lithium niobate integrated photonic platforms. The demonstrated AWGs will enable new applications in high-capacity telecommunication, high-resolution imaging, and high-speed sensing. This work has been published in [[ACS Photonics 9, 3253–3259 (2022)](/ASC2022_YU.pdf)]. To further leverage the excellent optical properties of LiNbO3, I explored the acousto-optic modulation and second-harmonic-generation on this platform. My research results have been published in [[Nanophotonics 10, 4323 (2021)](/Nanop2021_YU.pdf)] and [[Laser & Photonics Reviews 16, 2100429 (2022)](LPR2022_YE.pdf)]. In the long term, this architecture can be extended directly to other functional materials for developing functional photonic integrated circuits for optical communications, nonlinear optics at the single-photon level, and scalable photonic quantum information processors.

### (Ⅱ) Mechanical bound states in the continuum
To minimize the mechanical dissipation in micro/nanomechanical resonators, I applied the concept of BIC in the design of optomechanical resonators and, for the first time, experimentally realized and observed the mechanical BICs in optomechanical resonators. Compared with conventional designs, the demonstrated high-quality optomechanical resonators are robust against structural variations, which substantially reduces the device fabrication difficulties and allows for their operation in versatile environments. This work has been accepted by [[Light Sci. Appl. 11, 328 (2022)](/LSA2022_YU.pdf)].
